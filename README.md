# DefinedIntegrals
Defined integrals app with python which approssimates the value of a defined integral trough the rectangles method , the trapezoids method and the parabolas method
keep in mind that this demo is pretty buggy
if the trapezoid code or the parabolas code return an error while compiling try to fiddle around with the number of sections,for example if you tried 15 go for 30 or less
